# Hasbro-Blizzard-Stock-History
This is data that I will use for a personal analysis into 2 of the companie's competing products.


The contents include historical stock data for the 2 companies spanning decades and are part of 
a larger group of datasets that detail stock market history for the different US exchanges. They 
came from kaggle and are entries in the NASDAQ csv section.
